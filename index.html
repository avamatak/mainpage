		<p style="font-size:20pt; background-color:floralwhite;color: PaleVioletRed"> My name is Ava, and this is my p5.js creations website. I was born in New Jersey, but I have been living in West Virginia. My favorite animal is a toad, and my favorite color is light green. I love sushi, mountain dew, and swimming.</p>
