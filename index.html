		<p style="font-size:20pt; background-color:floralwhite;color: PaleVioletRed"> My name is Ava, and this is my p5.js creations website. I was born in new Jersey and moved to West Virginia during 5th grade. My favorite animal is a toad, and my favorite color is light green. I love sushi, mountain dew, and swimming.</p>
		<p style="font-size:24pt; background-color:Honeydew;color: PaleVioletRed"> My Projects </p>
		<p style="font-size:20pt; background-color:floralwhite;color:PaleVioletRed">I have started working with code this year, mostly in p5.js. I have learned many things such as motion, loops, and making many different programs.</p>
		<p> here is a link to one of my favorites: <a href="https://avamatak.github.io/ivy/"target = new window>ivy</a></p>
