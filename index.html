		<p style="font-size:24pt; background-color:Honeydew;color: PaleVioletRed"> About Me</p>
		<p style="font-size:20pt; background-color:floralwhite;color: PaleVioletRed"> My name is Ava, and this is my p5.js creations website. I was born in New Jersey, but I have been living in West Virginia. My favorite animal is a toad, and my favorite color is light green. I love sushi, mountain dew, and swimming.</p>
		<p style="font-size:24pt; background-color:Honeydew;color: PaleVioletRed"> My Projects </p>
		<p style="font-size:20pt; background-color:floralwhite;color:PaleVioletRed">I have started working with code this year, mostly in p5.js. I have learned many things such as motion, loops, and making many different programs.</p>

You simply need to include an adequate measure of text to make the scrollbars appear. Clearly, this isn’t enough,o we should accept we have somewhat more to state. In the end, the scrollbars will prove to be useful. That is it! :)</div>
