			<p style="font-size:32pt; background-color:tan;color: green"> A new theory by Roger Seymour argues that sauropods (long-neck dinosaurs) actually didn't hold their necks up vertically. Instead, they kept their necks horizontal to the ground, like an alligator. He states how sauropods would have spent as much as 75 percent of their bodies' energy to keep their heads held high. Most mammals use about 10 percent of their energy to circulate blood through their bodies. He also states how it would nearly be impossible for the animal's heart to maintain the blood pressure and strength needed to pump blood to the animal's brain. </p>
